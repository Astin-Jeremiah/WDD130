                    <p>Hello! My name is Jeremiah Astin. I am currently an applied technology student at Brigham Young University Idaho Online. I have always been interested in computers and the internet and I have really enjoyed learning HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and SQL.</p>
                    <p>I was born in Anchorage, Alaska, but my father was in the Airforce so we moved all around the country. I currently reside in Dayton, Ohio where I have lived for the last 13 years. I am married to my lovely wife Ashley and we have a daughter name Karleigh and a pit bull named Melon. In 2010 I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Marketing from Wright State University. I currently work as the Director of Ticketing for Dayton Live, a local performing arts center.</p>
                    <p>This website was designed to showcase some of the projects I have competed as a student as well as a place to post my resume.  Please feel free to <a href="#"">contact</a> me with any questions.  Thank You!</p>
